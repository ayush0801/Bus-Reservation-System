# Bus-Reservation-System
This is a straightforward Bus Reservation System built in C++. 
This program allows you to enter bus information and subsequently reserve a bus seat based on available seats. 
It also allows you to see the currently available buses and the available number of seats on each bus. 
Furthermore, one can get the fare based on the number of seats booked. And it also shows the total revenue at the end of the program. 
This is a simple implementation of C++ code that uses class and structure.
